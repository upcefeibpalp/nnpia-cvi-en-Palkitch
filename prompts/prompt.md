Spring Boot DevTools is a set of tools that can help improve the development experience when working with Spring Boot applications.

### Purpose of Spring Boot DevTools:
- **Automatic Restart**: Automatically restarts the application whenever files on the classpath change. This helps in quickly seeing the effects of code changes without manually restarting the application.
- **LiveReload**: Integrates with LiveReload to automatically refresh the browser when resources change.
- **Configurations for Development**: Provides sensible defaults for development, such as enabling debug logging and disabling template caching.
- **Remote Debugging**: Supports remote debugging of applications.

### Biggest Advantage:
The biggest advantage of Spring Boot DevTools is **improved development speed and efficiency**. By automatically restarting the application and refreshing the browser, developers can see the results of their changes almost immediately, which significantly reduces the development cycle time.
